Credence percentage choices
===========================

The game currently offers the following choices per answer::

  Percentage: 50%     65%     80%        90%      99%
  Odds:       1:1     2:1     4:1        9:1      99:1
  Difference      2:1     2:1     2.25:1     11:1

The arguments for this setup are:
* We want to teach people what gut feeling corresponds to which credence and
  they will learn faster if the choices are significantly different. Learning
  the difference between 50% and 60% should be harder than learning the
  difference between 90% and 99%.
* The 50% option is necessary to allow players to say "I have no idea".
* An option close to 50% is useful to allow players to say "I have a vague
  feeling about this."
* The 99% option is necessary to allow players to say "I'm absolutely certain."
